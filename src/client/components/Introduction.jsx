          I am a computer science and engineering undergraduate student at
          the <a href="https://www.guc.edu.eg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">German University in Cairo</a> (2017-2022).

          Coding always has been my passion. I love using code to bring ideas to
          life. Recently I found my enthusiasm is growing towards web and
          mobile development, since then I never stopped learning new frameworks
          and technologies. I enjoy building projects, from small single-page
          applications to huge interactive ones.
        </p>

          Half of my time spent coding and the other half spent either in arts
          or searching for new interesting books to read <span role="img" aria-label="aria-label">ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</span>  <span id="book-recommend">(Recommend me a book)</span>. I also enjoy
          travelling and exploring but I rarely do because I am a lazy introvert
          who prefers staying at home.
